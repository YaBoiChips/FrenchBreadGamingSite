            <p>
                French Bread Gaming was founded by friends who love to play games together. Everybody knew the
                after-school plan: Ethan’s place, smash bros. We’d chat about boring classes, make fun of Eric for
                following up a skilled combo with a mind-boggling missed ledge grab, and overall just enjoy each other’s
                company.
            </p>
            <p> French Bread Gaming is a story about community coming together. When we started, it was like 6 people
                in
                North Glenora Community Hall with a dream of running a major. But with support from new friends we made
                along the way - whether that be our
                regular crowd, the team at the Canadian Brewhouse, or so many others who have helped us out - French
                Bread Gaming has grown. Now some of the best players in the world come to Edmonton just for our events!
            </p>
            <p>
                French Bread Gaming’s mission is to bring world-class eSports events to Edmonton while promoting the
                community that raised us. We want to host world-class talent; we also want to promote Edmonton and
                AB-based talent as we gain a larger audience. Most importantly, we want any person to feel like they can
                come to our events and have fun!
